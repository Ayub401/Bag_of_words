# Bag_of_words
In this repository one can learn to code the bag of words from scratch.

BOW is one the easiest technique to vectorized text data so that it can be feed to a machine learning model. This is required as computer only undertstand the number and not the string/text.

It’s an algorithm that transforms the text into fixed-length vectors. This is possible by counting the number of times the word is present in a document. The word occurrences allow to compare different documents and evaluate their similarities for applications, such as search, document classification, and topic modeling.

It is called a “bag” of words, because any information about the order or structure of words in the document is discarded. The model is only concerned with whether known words occur in the document, not where in the document.
